  It is quite some time, since the media has talked about women and women related crimes such as rape, molestation, sexual harassment etc. While we saw the massive protest for the December 16th 2012, Delhi Gang Rape case; there was no such major protest for the August 22nd 2013, Mumbai Photo Journalist rape case or when a man in Ludhiana raped his minor daughter for four months continuously. These are just few dipstick samples, which have come to limelight with the support of media. There are many cases which we see happening around us in our day to day life, yet we tend to ignore and carry on with our path.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Every other day, we have news of such crimes, which by nature it should create restlessness among the common man. But considering the rate at which it appears in media, they are no more “THE BREAKING NEWS”. Sadly we seem to have got immune to it.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  It is true that, we all are active in social media such as Facebook, You Tube, Twitter etc, to comment and share are diverse opinions of such incidents, and at times fail to look at our own self.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Let me share a very well known, yet overlooked tale of someone who is very close to YOU. Yes, I know about someone who is close to you. Here goes the story;
</p>

> SHE is a Woman. She is married and runs the family. She gets up at four in morning, cooks breakfast and lunch for her husband and children. She finishes all the odd jobs such as cleaning vessels, washing clothes, sweeping, mobbing etc. She makes the children ready for school in the most neat and tidy manner along with giving them healthy and nutritious food. She makes sure her husband’s personal and office requirements is ready on time and sends him off to office with a bright and warm smile. After all this, she is ready to serve and help her in laws. After settling everyone, she runs to her office with a slice of bread in her hand, to eat on her way. As she enters the office, the clock says, “You are late by ten minutes”. Setting apart the frustration, she starts her day with the same zeal and zest, fulfilling all her official tasks. As the clock strikes four, she runs to school to pick her children, and reaches home. Once home, she is back to her house work station, and gets started the preparation of evening snacks and dinner, in between, making sure, kids don’t spend much time on playing and get back to their studies. At 8 PM , the dinner table is set. Children and in laws are served the food, after which the children are made to sleep with amazing bed time stories. She keeps seeing the clock, waiting for her husband to arrive and share the dinner table with him. After long wait, at 11PM he arrives from office, and he says, “I have already had my dinner, you carry on”. With the disappointment, she has her half dinner and reaches her bed at 12.30 in the night. Just when she is exhausted and tired, without any option, she has to satisfy her husband in every way possible. And the cycle of her life revolves around this duration of time.

<p align="justify">
  Do you know who she is? Do you know who plays this role throughout the day, without any complaint or protest? She is YOUR WIFE who is not only your wife, but plays the role of a mother, daughter, daughter in law, sister, sister in law, friend, and companion for many.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  You might be wondering why did I have to tell a story which is very well known to you? Time for every man to peep into your conscience. At the outside, you might give hundred reasons for rapes happening to women, and blaming and cursing her, for her own problems.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  But now it is time for you to think what is happening in your relationship with your partner. Every time when your wife is tired and exhausted; not ready for sex, she is forced to have it, just to fulfil her “HUSBAND’S DESIRE’S”. This might not be legally and constitutionally considered as rape, but to me this is also a “RAPE”, because she is doing it for you, though she is not voluntarily fascinated about it. Hence it can be rightly said that, RAPE HAPPENS IN EVERY HOUSE.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Time that every man stops pointing fingers towards others, and start looking into one’s own actions. Time for all the husbands to start respecting HER wishes and wants. Stop RAPING your wife and taking HER for granted.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Sex has to be mutually desired expression of love without any compulsion. If it is not mutual, and if it is forced, then sadly, every time you are having sex, you are RAPING your partner. Period.”
</p>

<p align="justify">
  P.S: This article is not hurt anyone’s sentiments, or thoughts. It is my opinion, which I want all the husbands and going to be husbands, to read and think about. And next time you have sex consider HER wish also and I am sure, your relationship will be much happier and satisfying
