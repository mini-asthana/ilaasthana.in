**A Life of Perseverance & Patience**

A recent conversation that I overheard while I was travelling in bus, that hit me brutally, it was a conversation was between the mother of a differently abled child, who was trying to make her child stand comfortably in the crowded bus, with another middle aged working woman. The woman commented on the struggling mother and child, _“Don’t know why such people travel in bus and make other people’s journey uncomfortable”_, along with commenting on that child as a burden for the parents and society.

We humans have come a long way in the process of evolution. This world is a mix of normal and differently abled people. Over the years, perceptions towards disability have varied significantly from one community to another. Still our society looks down at these special children, in an abnormal fashion and treats them akin to untouchable humans.

Every child is unique and special. They have a life for themselves with their own desires. They should have the chance of their own freedom. We need to help the children with Disabilities get a chance at life that we all take for granted. In today’s Society we could help these children find their place in life and let them have opportunities, just like we have.  Just because some children look a little different, walk a little different, talk a little different, and act a little different, what right do we have to continually hold these children back from reaching goals and being productive in some manner?

While we have many studies and experiments for special children and their disorders like hearing impairment, blind, Autism, Downs syndrome etc. It is important to understand the attitude of parents of these children. Some parents always mourn at their child&#8217;s lost potential, and many conditions become more troubling with time. Other families may find that their child&#8217;s challenges make triumphs sweeter, and that weaknesses are often accompanied by amazing strengths.

At times many parents consider it as an emotionally draining task of life to groom these special children. Yet the end result to see these kids grow up in their own subtle ways, even in a slower rate, is highly satisfying. They believe that their children are full of surprises and they learn each day something new from them. These wonder kids have amazing maturity levels to forgive and let go people in every way. Some parents believe that their children are their ray of hope for life. No matter what is the attitude of society towards these children, they are always the glowing stars for their parents. It is a journey of perseverance and patience for lifetime to see the star twinkling each day.

Prejudism is a crime. It can be rightly said that we form an opinion on these children before we even have knowledge of who they really are, and who they can become. We assume that they can never live a normal life, and wouldn’t be able to fit in with society. There are adults and children out there who treat these children like they are the plague.

We as part of this society should take a look at our daily life and how we categorise people.  We need to educate our children who take life for granted that there are those children who are thankful for another day along with all the challenges that life gives them. We need to take time to get to know these children, give them a helping hand, give them some encouragement, self-esteem, a feeling of belonging, and importance.

We can’t help them all but we could make a big difference in some of their lives, if we would all just take the time to teach our children, families, co-workers, whomever to not forget that these children have feelings, and they are struggling as it is to make a place in life, and they don’t need any more stumbling blocks.

We need to remove the biggest stumbling block there is and that being Prejudism. There are so many types of Disabilities that children have some are born with them, some develop them from accidents, some come on later in life, but whatever their disability is, sometimes we as a society can be there biggest disabilities.

_Don’t crush the bud before it blossoms into beautiful flower of fragrance._ 

(P.S: This article is a tribute to parents of those _shining stars_, for their daring zeal and zest towards life and fighting for their child’s rights and comforts from the repulsive attitude of society.)
