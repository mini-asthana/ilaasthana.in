  It was a busy afternoon, with vegetable and fruits market on one side and buses, cars, auto etc., on the other side of road. Amidst this commotion, with headphones in my ears, listening to some random music, I was walking down the street, gazing the different colors of life. And then this happened with me.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  “A group of 5 people came to me. They kept their hands over my head and murmured a little, following which they asked me for some money. Just as every other small kid, even I was terrified to death for few seconds. Within few minutes, I gathered myself and asked them, “Why do you have to beg? You have perfect hands and legs, why don’t you make a living by yourself?” And they all busted out of laughter like I was making no sense to them and moved ahead”. I was standstill, rooted by the incident that had just happened. I was confused and I could not get past it. As I stood, a cycle came and hit me, which brought me back to my senses and I walked fast to my destination.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Walking as fast as I could, I was trying to recollect the words that I had spoken to them. It struck a hard blow in me, with blood boiling inside, shaming me to have spoken such words to them. Yes, I was being silly and was making no sense at all. My words were shallow and meaningless.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  They were right. Who will give them work? Who will hire them for their professional skill and ability? Who will pay them religiously for their talents? Who will respect and accept them the way they are, without knowing their identity? Can you? Will you? The quest to know who they are, keeps creeping everywhere, forever by the society.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Did you guess whom, I am talking about? I am talking about those, who are always pushed to darkness, for no fault of theirs. I am talking about those, who are considered an evil phantom for the society. Kids’ fear of them and adults make fun of them. Complete disrespect and disgrace is what they have got from the society.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Just for a second, think about a scenario, where people laugh at you for what you are. Everywhere you go, kids get scared of you. Irrespective of the gender, everyone makes fun of you. You crave for warmth, but what you get is, hurt and wound. Will you be able to survive that life of contempt? I doubt I can. But they do live it every day, and some live it with pride.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It is India’s 68th Independence Day. Right from celebrities to famous personalities from different walks of life etc., in short, every Tom Dick and Harry, is talking about what is freedom to them. We are actually gifted to talk about freedom, as it is granted to us. Unfortunately, even though they are a part of this free India, they are deprived from even the thought of expressing themselves.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  For a change, let’s halt our thoughts for some time, about our freedom, and think about their freedom. Let us take a step towards their freedom. Let’s help them regain their lost respect. Let us stop inculcating a wrong attitude in our children towards them. Let us free them, from the daunting eyes of the society. At the very least, let us try to treat them like our fellow human beings, and not as any animal in a cage.<br /> If not NOW, we will never eradicate this thought from the society.
