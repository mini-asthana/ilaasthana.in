This is a documentary which aims at creating awareness among the people about special children, ie. children whose mental development is challenged. Through this documentary, we intend showing people how these delicate flowers are treated, how they cope with the rest of the world, and why they should not be treated differently or looked down upon, but rather, should be treated equally, and made to feel as one among us.

We bring to you Ms. Priya Rajkumar, coordinating committee member of ‘Maithree’, an association of parents of exceptional children with mental handicap. She elucidates how these delicate children should be treated, and how they, at Maithree, help these children.

Time duration : 7 minutes.
