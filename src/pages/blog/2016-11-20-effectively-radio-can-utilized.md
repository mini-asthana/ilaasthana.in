Radio has greater potential in mass communication than the newspaper for two reasons. Firstly, it reaches even the remote corners of the country and has no physical impediments. Secondly, it imparts language education and provides entertainment and disseminates information to both literate and illiterate listeners. Radio is under government control for fear of its misuse and powerful influence. There are indications that soon we will have privately owned radio stations with their own programs of broadcasts all over the country. The range of programmes includes a wide variety of educational, cultural and entertainment items, aimed at a broad spectrum of classes of people.

The language used in radio impacted the previous generation very much. News broadcasts introduced chaste language, closely modeled after the written variety. The newsreaders introduced standard pronunciation values to the phonemes, words, phrases, and sentences. The impact of radio language was heavier upon the written style, rather than on the spoken idiom. This is somewhat strange, considering the fact that radio is mainly an audio form. It appears that Indian radio is more closely associated with news and music than with dialogue.

In India there is diversity in languages, and the formation of linguistic states has given impetus and importance to regional languages. There are newspapers in regional languages that have wider circulation than English or Hindi newspapers. Likewise, there are separate channels for each regional language in television and they provide entertainment programmes and news bulletins in that language, which will be more purposeful and effective in imparting education. Yet, the picture continues to be hazy, because with the growth of English education and new job opportunities, people seem to prefer to adopt English as an essential part of their education.

Radio is one of our most important ways of communicating. Since the late 1800s, when radio was invented, it has played a huge role in our lives. Communication between two far distant places became quicker and much more inexpensive than stringing telegraph wire. Suddenly, ship-to-ship and to-shore radios were saving thousands from disaster at sea, radio, entertainment broadcasts were going into peoples&#8217; homes, and soldiers in the field were able to keep in touch with friendly units.

Broadcasting is the most well known use of radio. Radio stations arrange songs and programs of particular genres to broadcast to listeners who tune in to hear them. Most stations provide short newscasts and talk radio provides a public forum where people can listen to interviews or call in to speak with the host or his or her guests. Sports events can be broadcast as an announcer provides a play-by-play description of the action. Companies can buy ad space on privately owned stations to air commercials designed to appeal to that station&#8217;s listeners. Besides all these, community radio stations can be effectively used for public services like creating awareness on AIDS, Anti-Smoking, child marriage etc.

In today’s scenario, Radio has a very significant place in the world which cannot be replaced by any other medium of communication. This medium of communication has not only been a tool of entertainment, but this has also brought the whole country together during crisis such as Tsunami, earthquake and even united the whole country to get justice for Jessica Lal. Thus, it’s true the fact that, a day would come when the whole media industry would be dominated by Radio Broadcasting.
