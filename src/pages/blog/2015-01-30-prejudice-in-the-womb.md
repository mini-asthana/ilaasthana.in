  As I lay down in bed to sleep, my thoughts wander, recollecting the happenings of the day. It was a tiring day not just because it was jam packed with tons of work at office, but also with the thoughts I was surrounded with. Unfortunately the day culminated with a reminder to one of the most harsh truths of our society.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>Scenario: </strong> : “Its 9.30 PM. Its dinner time. Television is on. We (Me and My Mother) take our plates and continue watching a mega serial. The main female lead character of the mega serial is pregnant for the second time. Her elder son asks her about baby shower. As she begins to explain the ritual of baby shower, there is a wide smile of joy and happiness in the face of the boy. It felt like, he immediately had dreams and plans to celebrate the coming of the new baby in the most extravagant fashion. Unfortunately the smile frowned within few seconds, as the mother continued to elucidate that the baby showers are rituals which are done only for the first child”.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Why do we adore a pregnant lady? Why do we perform baby showers? Is it a festival to celebrate in a grand fashion? Why do we have to make it a big ritual?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Baby showers are celebrated during pregnancy to welcome the unborn baby to the family and bless the mother-to-be with abundant joys of motherhood. Baby showers are way to express our joy, excitement and happiness for the new entry in the family and to wish the best for the parents.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>My question to the society is – Why is baby shower ceremony performed only when the first child is born?</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Are you not having the same level of happiness when you are going to become parents for the second time? Are you not excited for the second child, just how you were when you had the first child? If not, then why do you even need to have a second child? Or is it just a societal pressure?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It can be argued that, grooming two children without any favoritism is one of the biggest challenges for the parents. Knowingly or unknowingly, there could be predisposition in thoughts and actions of the parents. Though it is seldom intentional, yet, it has a chance to affect the child deeply for years to come.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The sad state is, this predisposition, does not just happen when the baby is born. This starts when the child is in the womb of the mother.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>Yes. Prejudice in the Womb. Period.</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Just ponder for a second, if as parents it is right on our part to deny our child, our own bloods everything he or she deserves to get. What will you answer your child, when he or she asks why you did not have a baby shower for him or her? Can we get away by stating this as a societal ritual? What will you say, if he or she asks were you not happy when I entered your life? Do you love the other sibling more?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Answer this to yourselves as parents.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  A genuine request to all parents, family members and the society as a whole – “Do not be biased in your thoughts and actions. Every child is unique and special. Celebrate the birth of every child”.
</p>
