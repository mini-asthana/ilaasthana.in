  Every child of 1980’s, 1990’s and much before that, would completely agree to the statement that, our childhood and the memories inclined to it, were priceless. Our childhood was the best. As the clock strikes 5.00 PM, the streets and parks were filled with children, parents, grandparents etc., former to play cricket, lock and key, shuttle, 7stones etc. and later for their respective time of social interaction. There used to be no class, no age bar. Every colony, every lane, was vibrant, colourful and filled with those wonderful and lively sounds of utmost frequency. Every place had a life of innocence and purity for itself. It was reminiscence for lifetime.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Those were the days, when children used to play in mud and water in streets, park, with toys, and learn to share and care for each other. Today all this has been replaced with, computer oriented video games and gain varied knowledge with click of a mouse. The present generation children learn and act instantaneously from what they see.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Today the meaning of childhood and the memories has changed. The streets are empty with no colours in them. There is no more life in any of the parks or colonies. Today people are so engrossed in themselves. Today the space of streets and colonies, have been replaced by gtalk, whatsup, hangouts, text messages etc. Today it is more of digital media interaction than a one on one handshake. Hence, today’s children also prefer to get glued with technology.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  With the immense intensification in the growth of media and technology, children have become so creative and intelligent. Thanks to the competencies of the media and technology. The minute they come into this world, they are exposed to various types of media such as mobile, camera, telephone, internet, iPod etc. Surrounded by technology, their attitude is also tech-savvy.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  With the expansion and incredible reach of media, the children are given platform and opportunity at a very young age to explore themselves in every arena. It is a happy moment for parents when child grows faster than what they would have expected.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Besides the varied advantage, studies and experiments have shown that children these days lose their innocence by the age of 12, Thanks to the pressures and pleasures of modern life, internet and celebrity culture. Today’s children get matured faster, right from the way they talk to the way their attitude towards life, which is very astonishing for the elders to accept.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Many parents give their children unlimited pocket money, surround them with gadgets, take them for shopping at high-end retail stores, etc. On the other end of the spectrum are parents who force their children to excel in everything — be it extracurricular activities or studies. In the race to always win, children are not allowed to enjoy and relish the moments. They are forced to always be the best. It would be right to say that, today’s children have lost their childhood. They have lost their innocence. Such parents need counselling.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Is it time for us to go back to olden days, where we were technology free and keep our kids safe, giving them lots of memories of childhood? Is it possible to get rid of technology? Who is to be blamed, parents or children?
</p>

<p align="justify">
  At this early stage, it depends on parents how they groom their kids. It is incorrect to blame the kids. With a check on the exposure of the media on children, it is the responsibility of parents to make sure kids don’t lose their innocence, giving them opportunities to enjoy and create memories for lifetime. Children are like clay, they get moulded into the exact shape that you put them in.
