**Being Blind… What are you blinded by?**
A group of people knotted to each other for being blind. A small stick of its own kind assures the presence of their group and the conformity of the path. A regular scene experienced while crossing the roads near my house, questioned the inner inquisitive mind. An unparalleled conversation with those blinded people, who are suffering for no fault of theirs. A result of birth, accident, sexual harassment, etc., were some of their reasons of blindness. However, their vision of the inner self is far beyond the challenges of biological defect. 

Ignorance, neglect, fear, helplessness, distrust, uncertainty, weakness, etc., were some of the emotions common to all of them. Having said that, they were all happy and peaceful in their own world, sharing their emotions and showing a ray of hope in life to each other. An hour of dialogue which was filled with love, passion and confidence. No emotion of self-pity was felt.

A conversation which concluded with a striking message from one of the survivors in the room, _**‘Yes, it is true that we are blind and we have our own problems. But, the truth is, people who are bestowed with vision, are blinded in real sense. They are blinded by self-pride, jealousy, hate, anger, social stigmas etc. It is better to be blind than to have sight to witness the atrocities of the world. We are in a happy and peaceful world. It is time to this what you are blinded by’.**_

Today, the 4th of January is celebrated globally as World Braille Day. A day to commemorate Louise Braille, the creator of Braille, a means of communication for people who are blind. Louis Braille was born in France on January 4, 1809. Louis Braille developed the 6-dot fingertip reading system known as Braille. It is not a language, but rather a code that can be translated into many languages. A reading and writing system used by millions of blind and partially sighted people all over the globe. 

World Braille Day provides an opportunity for teachers, charities and non-government organizations to raise awareness about issues facing the blind and the importance of continuing to produce works in Braille, providing the blind with access to the same reading and learning opportunities as the sighted.

My writings are a source to create awareness and tickle the consciousness of the readers, by providing adequate factual information. On this World Braille Day, where on one side, I pledge to aid the blinded souls in ways possible, on the other side, I urge my audience to answer for themselves, ‘Are you blind? If yes, what are you blinded by?’
