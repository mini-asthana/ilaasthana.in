Pinching the cheeks, pulling the hair, hitting on the head, mocking at her to eat less, even though she is thin, countless complaints to mother, above all, fighting against all the odds of the neighborhood for each other’s protection, glorifies the ‘knot’ty tales of the beautiful brother – sister relationships. Even though I have a sister, who is no less than a brother, we have always cherished this fascinating childhood relationship.

As I was writing this tantalizing tale, I came across this recent advertisement of Cadbury Celebrations for Rakshabandhan. (If you have not yet viewed, [Click Here][2] to view the ad). Cadbury Celebrations, always enlightens the audience with unique and captivating advertisements during the festive seasons, and takes the festive bonds, one step ahead of commercialism.

Falling on the Shravan Purnima (the full moon day) of Shravan month (as per the Hindu calendar), ‘Rakshabandhan’ is an Indian festival of tying the knot of amity and brotherhood. The word ‘Raksha’ means “protection” and ‘Bandhan’ connotes “the bond”. “Rakhi” is the sign of the brother – sister relationship for life. So, it signifies the bond of protection against the evils and perils of this world. It is the affection, admiration, love, fondness, respect and emotional bonding that adds meaning to the occasion. 

Like other festivals, history gives evidences about the significance of this festival as well. For instance:
  
•_ **Yama and Yamuna:**_ According to a mythological tale, Yama, the Lord of death, was blessed with eternity as his sister Yamuna tied up a Rakhi thread on his wrist. Since that time the festival of Raksha Bandhan is associated with tying of rakhi thread.
  
• _**Rabindranath Tagore’s call to nation:**_ During the partition of Bengal in 1905, Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel laureate poet used the occasion of the Raksha Bandhan as a community festival and gave a call to tie a rakhi amongst all Hindus and Muslims so as to maintain peace and harmony between them and spread the nationalist spirit among people from different ethnic backgrounds.

These are just few examples, but history engraves endless tales, that has brought this festive season into existence.

Born in the land, where relationships are celebrated and cherished, Rakshabandhan, is one of my favorite festivals. For me, rakhi is not merely a thread, but a resilient knot of relationships between siblings and a reason for the whole family to gather. It is a day to remember the infinite memories of childhood and relish them with warmth for each other in the heart. Even though, it is a celebration of blood related siblings, today, it goes beyond those relations and shares the same emotion of brotherhood and sisterhood with your closely knitted peers signifying a peaceful co-existence of every individual. 

In this fast paced world, pause for a second, look back to your childhood and seize this opportunity to show your loved ones, what they mean to you. A solemn promise and an assurance of unconditional love, affection and care, above all, to be a pillar of strength for each other, symbolizes this picture perfect relationship. 

I dedicate this writing, to all the brothers & sisters of my life. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you all for always being there for me and moulding me for what I am today.
