#### A serious threat to the city

Notwithstanding the recent warning by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) against dumping of garbage and untreated sewage in the Pallikaranai marshlands, the illegal dumping and burning of garbage by the corporation is a clear and omniscient threat to the residents of the vicinity.

What will it take to get them to stop this reckless destruction of ecological balance? We will have to wait and watch, because if there is one thing we cannot expect, it is proactive action from the government. So this story is yet another step to provoke the government to WAKE UP and look at the reality of our SINGARA CHENNAIâ€¦
