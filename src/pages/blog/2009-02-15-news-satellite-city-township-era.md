#### The new life style which Chennai City is adopting

A satellite town or satellite city is a concept in urban planning that refers essentially to smaller metropolitan areas which are located somewhat near to, but are mostly independent of, larger metropolitan areas.

These are generally with following characteristics

  * predate that metropolis&#8217; suburban expansion
  * Are at least partially independent from that metropolis economically and socially
  * Are physically separated from the metropolis by rural territory or by a major geographic barrier such as a large river; satellite cities should have their own independent urbanized area, or equivalent
  * Have their own bedroom communities.
  * Have a traditional downtown surrounded by traditional &#8220;inner city&#8221; neighborhoods
  * May or may not be counted as part of the large metropolis&#8217; combined statistical Area

In recent times there is people have started adopting this new life style. Here is a story which gives more details of the same.

                  Establishment of satellite towns always helps decongesting a city&#8217;s property markets. But, the intensity of investor and buyer interest depends upon the facilities provided by these townships. The real estate developers are all the way positive about these townships and feel that this is where the real potential for growth exists. Property brokers in Chennai also feel that new developments will revive investor interest in the city and the buying activities will catch up owing to the low price levels these townships would offer.
