#### Mrs.Janaki Sabesh

The well known film advertising artist, a person loved by all of us. Who doesn’t know her? Known for her, most amazing style of dialogue delivery in the film industry, she is also an active member of Rotary Club of Madras, doing several social services for the betterment of the society. So let us meet this young lady and know something more about her.

> **Question: We heard that from your childhood, you always imitated others. So when acting exactly did become your career or why did you choose ACTING as your profession?**
> 
> **Mrs.Janaki Sabesh:** Yes, from my childhood I loved imitating others and make fun out of it. When I was 10 years old, I was given the opportunity to act in an advertisement. As my parents were broad minded, I was able to use the opportunity. By God’s grace, the advertisement became very successful and everybody in the film industry liked my face. So that’s how I entered the film industry.

> **Question: How was your experience in the films like “JEANS”, “BOYS” and “GILLI”?**
> 
> **Mrs.Janaki Sabesh:** Yes, from my childhood I loved imitating others and make fun out of it. When I was 10 years old, I was given the opportunity to act in an advertisement. As my parents were broad minded, I was able to use the opportunity. By God’s grace, the advertisement became very successful and everybody in the film industry liked my face. So that’s how I entered the film industry.

> **Question: Who has been the major source of inspiration for you in your life?**
> 
> **Mrs.Janaki Sabesh:**I am person who always aspires to learn things from any individual, no matter whether they are younger than me or older than me. Books are the major source of information. So there is no single person from whom I have inspired. I believe in destiny.

> **Question: Now days you are seen in the advertising field also. So why this transformation? What made you to be a part of advertising industry?**
> 
> **Mrs.Janaki Sabesh:**Yes, I like acting in advertisements. I am basically a broad minded person. I always use the opportunities which knock my door, to the best of it. Moreover, the time consumed is very less.

> **Question: What did you like the most – “FILM” or “ADVERTISING” industry?**
> 
> **Mrs.Janaki Sabesh:**Both have their own importance and advantages. In both, it’s the individual’s talent depicted. So it all depends on how one performs and expresses his thoughts and feelings. But, I love advertising industry, because that’s where my career started.

> **Question: So what was the major difference that you found in these two huge industries?**
> 
> **Mrs.Janaki Sabesh:**The major difference between a film and an advertising industry is the time consumed. You actually need to wait for a long time to see the results of the work. You won’t even have an idea of how the film would be when it is released. In advertisements, you can predict the output. In this more creativity and props are used.

> **Question: Which field do you find more comfortable and why?**
> 
> **Mrs.Janaki Sabesh:**For me, any field is fine. Any field will be comfortable if proper communication is seen among all the people involved in the production. So “FIELD” doesn’t matters. A person’s interaction with others is the one which affects the whole situation.

> **Question: You conduct seminars on communicative skills and the importance of tone modulation in one’s speech, in particular. We would like to know something about it?**
> 
> **Mrs.Janaki Sabesh:**Yes, I conduct seminars on presentation and communicative skills for school children I also take classes on “How important is tone modulation in one’s speech?” I work with an organisation called “We are the people” which originated in Japan and I recently had an opportunity to give a lecture on this in Singapore. This is just to make youngsters aware of the importance of body language in their life.

> **Question: Being in the same field, what would you like to comment on the recent trends of both Film and Advertising industry?**
> 
> **Mrs.Janaki Sabesh:**The recent trends of film and advertising industry are the result mixture of Creativity and Advancement in the Technology. Yes, it is to be admitted that, the range of vulgarity is seen increasing day by day and because, even kids see the Television, they get easily affected. But, the creativity is used in the negative sense. So, if the knowledge and creativity, along with technology are used in a positive sense, then films and advertisements can not only entertain the people, rather be a tool for educating them.

> **Question: What would you like to tell the upcoming artistes of both film and advertising industry?**
> 
> **Mrs.Janaki Sabesh:**I would like to say one thing, “Be yourself and don’t get influenced while entering this industry and have a positive attitude towards your profession and never lose hope, no matter what happens. If this is the kind of mentality, one would surely reach the success”.
