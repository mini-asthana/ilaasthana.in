Shades of My Life ðŸ™‚

Its 6:00 PM in the evening. As I wake up from a power nap, within few seconds suddenly both myÂ mind and heart speaks a lot about food, cooking, eating, dining, serving etc. May be I had dreamsÂ about food. And Yes! My taste buds are all agitated and hyperactive. In reality, my taste buds neverÂ get satisfied. And every time I look at food they start jumping and craving, just like how small kidsÂ jump and dance when they see toys. It might be hilarious, but the truth remains.

Cooking has been my one of the few hobbies, which I have always tried to pursue till this time (willÂ always continue to do so :)). My mother, who is a Cook by her profession, has been the greatestÂ inspiration to me. (Love you Ma for that :)). Till date my mother confesses to everyone that whenÂ I was in Third Class of my schooling, I had prepared the best dough for the breads,(i.e for theÂ chapathis). Though I don&#8217;t remember any such memory of mine, till date she always appreciatesÂ me for that job. May be this all culminated into Cooking becoming, my hobby. It was every SundayÂ that my mother was given a break from the kitchen by me, and I used to cook for everyone. ThisÂ opportunity was best utilised by me, as I tried new variety of dishes, adding my own flavours andÂ serving the family with full of love, warmth and big smile ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ . Some dishes came out well, somewere really pathetic. But it was all part of the game ðŸ™‚ ultimately my family had to eat as they had noÂ other option :). The best part was no matter how pathetic the dish was, they always ate with a smile ðŸ™‚Â which always encouraged me to cook for them. As I grew, and when I was in Class 9 of school, IÂ had participated in an inter school cookery competition. I had cooked Malai Kofta with Roti (Yes guysÂ I will make it for you some day, thatâ€™s a promise from me). I was very excited. But when the resultsÂ came out, I did not win. But the competition induced an urge in me to cook new dishes. It taught meÂ that no matter how many times you fail, some day you will learn the dish perfectly. And that was aÂ lesson for lifetime. As time passed, I learnt that cooking means perfect blend of right ingredients atÂ the right time. In aesthetic sense, the outcome of the dish also depends on the attitude with whichÂ you prepare the food.

Cooking has always been the biggest source of energy in me. No matter in which mood I am in, I amÂ always ready to cook and eat. Besides preparing the food, I always loved to serve for people, seeÂ them enjoying the food prepared by me and there words of appreciation. Cooking always broughtÂ sense of satisfaction and added colours to my life. I will always be proud that no matter whether IÂ succeed in my professional career or not, I will always be able to satisfy people around me and bringÂ a smile in their face with my cooking skills.

Its 7:00 PM. And itâ€™s time for dinner preparation. And today itâ€™s Cauliflower Stuffed Chappathi withÂ Cucumber Raitha.

Cheers to Food Lovers
