  <strong>Gender Genital Mutilation – An Atrocious Act</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  We quiver to death with the slightest bad touch from another human being. It is baffling, how we would react, if an amorous lump of flesh is removed from our personal part of the body, in the name of societal ritual and custom. More than <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/">100 million women and girls</a> of this world are the victims of the Gender Genital Mutilation (GGM). Yes. You have read it correct. Even today, in this clichéd modern world, this dreadful tradition prevails. True that, it does remain to be a taboo topic, not just in Indian society, globally as well. Gender Genital Mutilation is the most atrocious act of the mankind, irrespective of the gender practiced upon. In short, it is an ongoing torture to the human body for the rest of the life.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Gender Genital Mutilation is a century old, silent societal customary ruining the lives of millions of people. It is a heinous act of partial or complete removal of genital organs of the body for the non-medical reasons, at a tender age of 4 and 12, without their consent and knowledge. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of gender discrimination.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This ritual is practiced irrespective of the gender, although most of the times, female gender is the victim. The male genital mutilation is about removing the testes or penis and the female genital mutilation involves the cutting and removal of the clitoris, inner-and-outer lips of the vagina, and the sewing or stapling together of the two sides of the vulva leaving only a small hole to pass urine and menstrual.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Apart from the pain and distress involved in the procedure at the time, there can be long-term psychological and physical problems, at times involving infertility. Bladder and urinary tract infections and cysts are the most common effects. There is an increased risk of problems during childbirth, which could in extreme cases lead to the death of the baby. This is mostly carried out by traditional circumcisers, who often play other central roles in communities, such as attending childbirths. In many situations, health care providers perform such acts due to the erroneous conviction that the practice is safer when medicated. WHO strongly urges health professionals not to perform such procedures.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The gender genital mutilation is a scandalous and wicked act, performed very silently inside the closed doors. Most of the times, the victims are warned from opening their mouth about the act. Therefore the nonprofit societal organizations face a lot of challenges to procure data, needed to bring about the required change. It is an explicit violation of human right that needs to be condemned immediately. This concept is as disturbing as it may be, yet finds support in cross-cultural comparisons of cultures which mutilate the genitals. Despite a strict ban in 1996 in Egypt, this custom continuous to be a quarrelsome.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Social conditioning and secrecy are a dreadful combination. There has been much debate and discussion over the countless atrocities and challenges that Indian society faces. Yet, there are still ancient truths that are only now fighting to crawl out from under the carpet. Gender genital mutilation is one such practice.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Beyond the stringent laws and extreme capital punishment, chary conscious and cautious awareness campaigns about the consequences of such heinous acts on the victims, is the seed that needs to sow. The mounting and massive power of technology, along with collective responsibility of the citizens of the society, would definitely catalyze to expose and eradicate such brutal and infectious worms of the society. A small step towards the giant leap is the way ahead.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Stay Aware. Shout Out when something happens silently.
