  With the technological revolution and extensive reach of media and communication, blogging has become a vital part of everyday life. What started as a small space for communication of messages has turned out to be a serious business. For some people blogging is a hobby, for others it’s a workplace, but for many, blogging is a powerful marketing tool for brand and self-promotion. To make the best of blogging it is very essential to choose the right platform.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  WordPress, Tumblr, Blogspot etc. are the most popular solutions for this purpose with their own characteristics. A specific platform is selected depending on the requirements and the type of audience to be catered.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Studies have shown that, one in every six websites runs on WordPress, the most popular blogging platform in the world. WordPress is an open-source project. WordPress is flexible, and is both a free publishing tool (via WordPress.com), and a content management system for self-hosted blogs (via WordPress.org). The only expenses associated with running a WordPress blog are server and domain costs. WordPress is more of an actual host-service, and Tumblr is more of a social network made of blogs.

<p align="justify">
  WordPress has plugins and themes and can be customized to achieve a variety of functions. Though not as simple as Tumblr, WordPress takes little time to set up. However, because it is widely used, there are plenty of tutorials available to help anyone set up a WordPress site. WordPress allows total control with a wide swath of customizable CSS templates. Besides all this, rich-text editor, with the ability to easily format your text and images is available.

<p align="justify">
  WordPress users can share their posts instantly to a number of social networks, including Tumblr – with a single click. WordPress’s richer functionality when compared to Tumblr adds much more creative freedom and variety. WordPress does not distinguish between different post types, e.g. text or video, but uses a single form for all different types of posts you make.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  WordPress code is favoured by search engines, making it the best choice for SEO purposes. In most cases it is easier to get high page ranking for a WordPress site than any other blogging platform. WordPress.com gives you built-in analytics in order to track the traffic through Google Analytics, which needs to be installed. This feature is not seen in Tumblr.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Its structure allows creating accounts for contributors, and a robust internal accounts system allows you to build an organization of writers with different permission levels. Admins can edit the page itself, as well as publish posts. Editors can publish post. Writers can be prohibited from publishing, so you can check their work before they go live.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  WordPress is the platform of choice for the serious blogger who wants to focus on written content and compose more lengthy posts; when compared to Tumblr which is more suited for creative and image related to designs, photography etc.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  To me, WordPress means ultimate liberty and proprietorship. Being the most powerful blogging platform and integration of external tools, including Google Webmaster Tools, Bing Webmaster Centre and Analytics software and option to add other users to the site, are interesting features which has made me to choose this platform.
