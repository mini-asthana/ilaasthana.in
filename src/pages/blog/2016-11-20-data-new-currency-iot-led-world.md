The large amount of data synthesis process is used in building the IoT architecture, and is constantly refined and monetized, converting data into “Data Currency”. In times to come, data currency will be used as a sole payment mode or in combination with money. Just like monetary currency, and bitcoin, “Data Currency” would act as a deciding factor of economic trade relations.

The value of IoT data or data currency is always in a state of flux. IoT data attains its utmost value in the milliseconds after it is seized and combined into real-time business intelligence.
